# 🎅 Secret_Santa
This year, a friend got an idea, she wanted to make a secret santa. What a wonderful idea !
The principle is simple, everyone has to send a present to someone else (determined by a draw) but nobody knows who sent it to whom.
The problem is, the one who drawn will know ! So I decided to create a program to solve the problem.

## How it works
